ABOUT KARMA POLICE:

Karma Police is an application which allows users to give and recieve anonymouse feedback from their friends. It creates a gamified experience where users can only get as much feedback as they give (Karma man!) and can also only see the aggregate results of friends questions for the questions they answered. 

The application is primarily mobile and as such had been built in a mobile-first, fully responsive format using elements from Twitter Bootstrap's flexible grid framework. LESS.js has also been used to enable easy global design changes to be implemented (I'm not a terrific designer). 

The final project includes the majority of the front-end UI for the application and will be integrated with Facebook's API with Parse on the backend. For the final project, dummy data for users will be used. 

PSEUDO CODE:

/*LOGIN PAGE*/

(1) User clicks on Facebook sign-in button and is directed to the "Me" page

FIRST TIME USER:

(2) User goes through the login flow via the standard facebook popups and agreements regarding privacy and publishing, new user account created

(3) Facebook's name and email become the default for the user

(4) First time users will get a welcome popup prompting them to get karma points by answering friends questions on network with a link to "Get Karma/Questiontiles" page

Text: "Earn Karma Points by answering friends's questions"

to do: !!! DECIDE ABOUT TOUR (whether "tour" or single intro screen is needed and how it should be structured, might to popups on each page for first time users with one line explanation)

RETURNING USER

(2) User directed to "Get Karma/Questions" page as default home screen


/*GET KARMA/QUESTIONTILES PAGE*/

(1) User clicks/taps YES/NO button for a friend's question

YES/NO On click:
- Icons in YES/NO buttons replaced with % results signs

- Badge on screen with Karma Point counter updates with new Karma Point Balance

DONE To do: !!! ADD BADGE TO SCREEN VERSION AND MOVE FOR MOBILE, GET RID OF N/A OPTION !!!

(2) User moves to a new quesion:

For Mobile:
On question area Swipe right:
- Screen returns a previously answered question

On question area Swipe left:
- Screen returns a new unanswered question

To do: !!! LOOK INTO SWIPE FOR NON NATIVE, MAY HAVE TO KEEP DELETE BUTTON FOR NON-NATIVE MOBILE !!!

to do: !!! CONSIDER OTHER FORMATS FOR QUESTION TILES - SHRINK FRIEND PHOTO & NAME, ADD PHOTO UPLOAD FEATURE OR MAKING TEXT LOOK LIKE A PRETTY PICTURE A LA QUOTER, OR MAKING LIKE DECIDERR NEWS REEL IF SWIPING FOR EACH SEEMS TOO CUMBERSOME

	here is my thought process, right now the action is (1) read question (2) click (3) check revealed answer (4) swipe, I feed like that might be too much, in a compressed newsreel formal it would be (1) read question (2) click (3) check revealed answer without the swipe. One alternative is to swipe automatically after a number of seconds with revealed answer, but still not 100%. 

	newsreel format:
		(+) seems like there is more happening, can scroll back up and glance at results again before page reload
		(-) also seems less like your friend asking you in a newsreel, its very much like instagram etc. it is almost less personal

	tinder "one-page" format:
		(+) You feel like its a person asking you, seems like your real friends there, more likely to answer and not simply scroll past
		(-) need to make some content on page the "star" so either photo uploads or making the text interestingly formatted in a variety of ways. Does having the friends photo so big make it seem less anonymous?
